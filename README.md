# Leave Management System

This project is a **Leave Management System** developed using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend. The system helps organizations manage employee leave requests, approvals, and records.

## Features

- **Employee Login**: Employees can log in to view and manage their leave requests.
- **Leave Application**: Employees can apply for leave, specifying the type of leave and the duration.
- **Leave Approval**: Admins can approve or reject leave requests.
- **Leave History**: Employees can view their leave history and status.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage employee leave records, including approving and rejecting leave requests.

## Requirements

Before running the system, you need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary dependencies. This will ensure that all libraries required for the project work correctly.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.8+)
- A code editor (VSCode, PyCharm, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Python Virtual Environment

1. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal/command prompt.
   
2. **Create a virtual environment** by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    - On **Windows**:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On **macOS/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    You should now see `(venv)` before the command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. **Install the required Python packages** by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install all the necessary dependencies, including Flask and other libraries needed for the project.

2. If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the required libraries (for example, Flask):

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

### Step 3: Configure the Database

1. If you are using a database like **MySQL** or **MongoDB**, ensure that your database is set up and running.
   
2. Modify the database configuration in the Flask application to match your environment (e.g., database URL, username, password).

### Step 4: Run the Application

1. Once the environment is set up, you can start the Flask application by running:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to access the Leave Management System.

### Step 5: Access the Application

- **Employee Login**: Use the employee login credentials to apply for and view leave requests.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Use admin credentials to manage leave requests and employee records.
